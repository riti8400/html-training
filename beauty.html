                    It was indeed a dream come true moment for Miss Universe Canada 2020 Nova Stevens, as she finally reunited with her family in Ethiopia after 21 years.
Capturing the emotions in their true essence, Nova took to her official Instagram account to express her feelings. She wrote, "Words can't explain how I feel right now. I'll try my best to express all these emotions I'm currently embodying. It has taken me 21 years to reunite with my family. Being separated and living alone without my family has not been easy for me; neither has it been for them. My strength comes from my family.

                  Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry that has considerable impact on the way ordinary people dress and present themselves and relies heavily on media and advertising to communicate the producer's preferences and goals and influence public perception through various types of promotion; at the same time, fashion can be influenced by social change and counter-trends outside the producer, retailer or advertiser's control.
