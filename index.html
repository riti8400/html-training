                    Fashion’s long agony dates back to way before Covid — to be sure,
                     the list of fashion-related bankruptcies is now getting longer every 
                     day thus accelerating its previous trend,but the root causes are not new.
                     Traditional fashion practice is dead. Time is ripe for scientific overhaul of the industry.
                     Bad for the environment, inaccurately priced based on cost-plus (!), and overly focused on image
                     & perception at the expense of execution, the industry has long been an accident waiting to happen.
                     I fully understood one thing about deep learning. It needs a lot of data to work. Without data,
                     it is just an advanced algorithm. It cannot produce any meaningful output alone.
                     This is more apparent when you start developing a deep learning model from scratch.
                     To put this in context, Open Images Dataset contains 9 million images that have been annotated with image-level labels
                      and object bounding box.It needs an enormous amount of effort to prepare such a gigantic dataset.
                     Well, the good news is, you can fine-tune a pre-trained model according to your needs with relatively less amount…

                  Impact on the fashion industry
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry that has considerable impact on the way ordinary people dress and present themselves and relies heavily on media and advertising to communicate the producer's preferences and goals and influence public perception through various types of promotion; at the same time, fashion can be influenced by social change and counter-trends outside the producer, retailer or advertiser's control. As fashion is driven by trends within and without the fashion industry, fashion blogs and other "new media" outside the control of traditional establishment represent a disruptive innovation to the social dynamics of mass media and fashion consumption in modern consumer society. It is likely that the blogosphere will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry, as the number of fashion based blogs continue to grow, with increasing numbers of consumers able to create and modify the media that they consume, and traditional producers and advertisers adapting their practices to avoid dilution of their own influence.
