                Lifestyle blogs are different than any other type of blog out there. They tend to focus on being a bit more visual and make certain that they are using high-quality images to showcase their activities and interests.

If you actually look up the word ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù in the dictionary, it literally means that it‚Äôs the way a person or a group lives.

Will there be stories told? Yes.

Will there be experiences discussed and talked about? Yes.

                Before we go on, I wanted to give you a quick reminder that once you‚Äôre ready to start your blog, I have a step by step tutorial. 

You can impact the lives of thousands of people while making a living working from home, and it starts at under $5 a month. Wait, what? It‚Äôs that cheap to start a blog? üôÇ

Okay, let‚Äôs continue‚Ä¶

                First and foremost, understand 100% and hear me loud and clear ‚Äì a lifestyle blog is not a personal blog or a place to showcase a diary of your life.

When a blog crosses over into personal stories and emotions, it‚Äôs now entered into the realm of a personal blog. While there are plenty of popular personal blogs, it‚Äôs imperative to understand that they are completely different from a lifestyle blog.

Whew! Now that we‚Äôve got that understood‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt get me wrong here. These two blogs are both super successful in the blogging industry. However, if you look at the followers and the engagement from the audience, it‚Äôs plain and simple to see that they attract a totally different audience and set of followers for each one.

            <p>
                As stated above, lifestyle focuses on interests and activities and finds fun ways to pull you in, while a personal blog finds ways to open up themselves, their stories and their lives with you through their writing.

Think about the last time that you read a blog article that really pulled at those heartstrings. More than likely, it was from a personal blog where the blogger was opening up and sharing something ‚Äúintimate‚Äù about their life while pouring out their heart and soul. Your first clue that it‚Äôs from a personal blog is that it‚Äôs ‚Äúoozing‚Äù emotion. (and that‚Äôs not a bad thing at all, it‚Äôs just not what a lifestyle blogger typically does!)
