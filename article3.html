                It was indeed a dream come true moment for Miss Universe Canada 2020 Nova Stevens, as she finally reunited with her family in Ethiopia after 21 years.
Capturing the emotions in their true essence, Nova took to her official Instagram account to express her feelings. She wrote, "Words can't explain how I feel right now. I'll try my best to express all these emotions I'm currently embodying. It has taken me 21 years to reunite with my family. Being separated and living alone without my family has not been easy for me; neither has it been for them. My strength comes from my family."
            </p>
            <p>
                On receiving an opportunity to safeguard the life and future of their child, Nova's parents took a chance and sent her away to Canada. "For a parent to send a child away on their own is one of the biggest sacrifices. We were apart for so many years, but the bond never faded. It was always there, and today I saw and felt the strength and love of my family both near and far." she stated.
Nova had a bittersweet feeling meeting her family. "I'm both happy and sad. Happy: because I finally got to see and embrace my family and tell them 'I LOVE YOU' in person. Sad: because of the conditions they are living in," she said.

                The bold and beautiful Nova who bridged her path to success on her own is a fine reflection of her mother. The diva sais she was short of words to describe how incredible, strong and beautiful her mother is. "If I can be half the woman my mother is, I'll be extremely happy," she exclaimed, further narrating her mother's ordeal. "My mother got out of the United Nations camp on January 21, 2021, after 8 years of being stuck there due to the conflict in South Sudan. The fact that she was able to make it out there alive is a miracle on its own. Hearing the stories, she would tell me and knowing that they once tried to burn her alive terrified me. There were times I didn't hear from her and thought of the worst-case scenario because it was very common to lose loved ones during that time. I truly believe that God made all of this happen. God brought her out and brought me back to them."
As she concluded, she expressed her gratitude to everyone who was instrumental in making her dream come true.
